# Configuring Tomcat Web Management Interface

- At this point, you should be able to access Tomcat with a web browser on port 8090. The web management interface is not accessible because we have not created a user yet.

- Tomcat users and roles are defined in the tomcat-users.xml file. This file is a template with comments and examples showing how to create a user or role.

- In this example, we’ll create a user with “admin-gui” and “manager-gui” roles. The “admin-gui” role allows the user to access the /host-manager/html URL and create, delete, and otherwise manage virtual hosts. The “manager-gui” role allows the user to deploy and undeploy web application without having to restart the entire container through the /host-manager/html interface.

- Open the tomcat-users.xml file and create a new user, as shown belo

```
sudo vim /etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml
```
Open this file and below lines

```

   <role rolename="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/>
  <user username="robot" password="admin" roles="manager-script"/>
  ```
